# Algorithms & Protocols Layer

Algorithm: a recipe for how things are constructed to complete a task

Protocols: a contract; set of steps that multiple devices have to follow in order for something to work
- ex: http & https

## Quantum Protocols:

Today we will go over a cybersecurity protocol.

### What is a key?

- A key is a piece of infromation that will unlock, decode, and decrypt sensitive information
- Distributing a key is dangerous (for interceptors)
- Is there a quantum property to tell if someone else saw our key?

### Quantum measurement:

- It alters the superposition of the key
- Assume a perfect quantum channel
- Phase 1: Sending
- Phase 2: Receiving
- Phase 3: Comparing
- Bases: + and - for x, 0 and 1 for z

### Quantum Key Distribution
