# Motivations

- Need to solve complex problems
- What is the most computationally complext thing you have done? (CAD simulation)
- Computational limits stand in the way of innovative breakthroughs
- Maybe these problems are solvable

## Quantum Computers

- Uses the properties of quantum mechanics to solve problems that classical computers cannot (uses bits)
- Classical computers have problems with:
    - Searching or testing
    - Encryption
    - Simulating quantum mechanical systems
- They all have large number of options or entries
- **Traveling salesmen problem (10B years on classical computer to do 26 cities)**

### The Quantum Stack
- Applications
- Algorithms and protocols
- Quantum circuits
- Quantum Gates & measurement
- Qubits (infinite number of states on sphere)

**Starting with the bottom three**

### Qubits

- They are on a 3D Bloch Sphere visually
- 3 dimensional coordinate system (z runs vertical, x-y come in and out of the page)
- 0 and 1 represented by complex numbers (x-y is complex)
- It is a quantum particle (diff ways to represent; electron/photon, a logical structure)
- Look up how they are stored in a machine

### Quantum Gates

- Applied to change and manipulate qubits

### Quantum Circuits

- These are a collection of gates applied to one or more qubits
- Synonymous to regular qubits
- We read these left to right
